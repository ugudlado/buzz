/**
 * Community icon, Buzz extension to NIP-43 + standard NIP-11 `icon`.

 * An admin/owner publishes a kind:9033 command carrying the icon in an
 * `["icon", value]` tag; the relay validates the sender's relay role and
 * stores the icon per community, serving it in the standard `icon` field of
 * its NIP-11 relay information document. Every member's client reads NIP-11,
 * so the whole community sees the same icon.
 *
 * The icon value is a small `data:image/*` URL (downscaled client-side
 * before publish) so it renders for INACTIVE communities straight from the
 * document — no cross-relay media fetch behind another relay's auth wall.
